## About Overlayer

Overlayer is building a new layer of money on top of today’s stablecoins, turning them from passive tokens into active, yield-enhanced assets that are easier to use, harder to censor, and designed for the way value moves in a digital world. Our vision is simple: anyone, anywhere, should be able to hold and move a stable, modern form of money that quietly works for them in the background—earning, compounding, and staying accessible across borders and platforms. Instead of reinventing money from scratch, Overlayer upgrades what already exists, aligning the interests of users, builders, and liquidity providers around a shared goal: making stable, transparent, and empowering financial infrastructure available to everyone.

## Our Vision

- **Money that works for you** – Your stable assets shouldn’t sit idle; they should quietly grow and stay flexible enough to move wherever you need them.
- **Open by default** – Access to modern financial tools shouldn’t depend on where you were born, your passport, or your bank.
- **Built for the long term** – We care about resilience, transparency, and sustainability over hype cycles.
